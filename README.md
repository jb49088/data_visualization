#### random_walks

A random walk is a path that’s determined by a series of simple deci-
sions, each of which is left entirely to chance. You might imagine a random
walk as the path a confused ant would take if it took every step in a ran-
dom direction.

Random walks have practical applications in nature, physics, biology,
chemistry, and economics. For example, a pollen grain floating on a drop
of water moves across the surface of the water because it’s constantly pushed
around by water molecules. Molecular motion in a water drop is random,
so the path a pollen grain traces on the surface is a random walk. The code
we’ll write next models many real-world situations.
